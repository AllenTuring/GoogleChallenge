For this we're going to use the Braille Alphabet. 
I will use this source: http://braillebug.afb.org/braille_print.asp
We probably want to initialize and encode it in some way that makes for constant-time access. Anything more would be silly. A Python dict or java HashSet sounds good.

We're going to have a 3-row output. I don't see any specification for newlines.
Each letter is being read in a 6-digit section by itself, so we don't have to worry about letters being inserted in the middle of the string. So each letter being a 6-digit string makes most sense. Then concatenation I guess.
