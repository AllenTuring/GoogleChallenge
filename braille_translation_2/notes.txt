For this we're going to use the Braille Alphabet. 
I will use this source: http://braillebug.afb.org/braille_print.asp
We probably want to initialize and encode it in some way that makes for constant-time access. Anything more would be silly. A Python dict or java HashSet sounds good.

We're going to have a 3-row output. I don't see any specification for newlines.
Each letter is being read in a 6-digit section by itself, so we don't have to worry about letters being inserted in the middle of the string. So each letter being a 6-digit string makes most sense. Then concatenation I guess.

I don't see any obvious pattern in this alphabet so we'll just hardcode it. It'll be fine, since there's no need to generate it algorithmically and it will never change. It's also a pretty small set.

We should detect capitals and add a capitalization mark before insertion of the letter, I think.

I'll start with Python. I'm also looking at https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_dictionary.htm to make sure I don't screw up with syntax.

Actually we can just encode the lowecase letters, then the uppercase letters derived from that as a 12 digit code.

I should have made this a separate branch instead of committing to master lol
